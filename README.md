# Artificial Intelligence - University project


###### What I used: Python, Pygame, Scikit-learn
 

My part of a group AI project. We had to create a virtual restaurant in Pygame and a waiter who had to wait the tables. In the beginning the waiter was moved manually with keyboard, later we had to use AI to teach him how to work independently. My part consisted of using a decision tree for learning. I created a method that gathered data from the environment and recorded the steps that I told the waiter to take. Then I created a decision tree with Scikit-learn, using the data that I had collected. Finally I tested the tree by forcing the waiter to wait the tables independently.
